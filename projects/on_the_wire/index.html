<h3>ON THE WIRE (2019)</h3>

<p>On the Wire is a performance of music/sound made entirely by the network - a combination of live and pre-recorded sounds received via a physical 'wiretap' of an internet connection in both send and receive directions. On the Wire makes audible the rhythms inherent in the act of sending and receiving using network protocols, and allows the audience to immerse themselves in the spatial and temporal dimensions of the network through sound.</p>
