<h4>11 Nov: Maroochydore Cable Landing Station</h4>

    <p>Remember when I was in Southport, talking about that old submarine telegraph cable? It turns out South-East Queensland has entered the submarine cable game again, this time on the Sunshine Coast. The new cable connects Maroochydore to Sydney and Guam of all places—though that's not as strange as it may sound. Guam is actually a major international hub of undersea cable connectivity, owing to its location in the middle of the West Pacific...oh, and the fact that it's a US territory.</p>
    <p>Not only is Guam a strategic location for connectivity to Asia and the Pacific for the US and companies doing business there, the US military also sees it as an important location, with 29% of the island occupied by military bases. Looking at Guam on a map, its proximity to a few countries the US has (or has had) some friction with may begin to explain why that is the case. </p>
	
    <p>Similarly to 1902, when a powerful Great Britain built and owned cables all over the world, this cable will be one of a growing number partially owned by Google.</p>
	
    <p>An unusual thing about this cable station—apart from the fact it's quite a way inland from the sea—is that it stands out amongst its surroundings. Traditionally, cable stations are hidden inside unassuming or purposefully misleading looking buildings to avoid unwanted attention or sabotage. Whether this kind of 'security by obscurity' has been found not to work or has simply been trumped by the local council's desire to showcase its location as a literal on-ramp to the information superhighway, I'm not sure.  
    </p>
    <p>Whatever the case, if you swim at Maroochydore beach in the future, take a moment to think about the 36 terabits per second of internet traffic flowing metres beneath your feet!</p>

    <p>Today I discovered that the first experiments with telephones in so-called Brisbane took place here at the General Post Office in 1878⁠—about 2 years after Alexander Graham Bell's initial demonstrations.</p>
	
	<p>The telephone was also demonstrated that year at a particularly ground-breaking Brisbane Exhibition, along with the electric light (!) and electric detonation of torpedoes in the creek running through Bowen Park (a precursor to the modern Ekka fireworks show?).</p>
    
    <p>But back to the GPO. In addition to being the central Post Office, a telegraph wing was added  in 1879 and a floor was dedicated for use as the first telephone exchange in the region in 1880. </p>
	
    <p>During World War II, the building's front was also used as a saluting dais for military parades. And while it's telegraphic, telephonic and militaristic days are over, the building continues to serve as an operational post office.</p>

    <p>The Old Windmill (I guess just "The Windmill" back then) is the oldest surviving convict-built structure in the city. It was used for a number of purposes, not the least of which were reputed public executions and the torturous practice of milling grain by treadmill as punishment (without trial) for gangs of prisoners. Some say there was never enough wind to mill grain on its own, others say the windmill did work but was continually in need of repair. But I digress...</p>
    <p>The windmill tower was used as a signal station to communicate (by semaphore—yep, waving red and yellow flags)  shipping information between the port and town. Railways, shipping, and other industry, also relied on the station for its function as a time keeping station. That ball you see at the top of the tower would drop at 1pm every day.</p>
    <p>The windmill later became a site for experimentation with radio, leading to Queensland's first  television broadcast being transmitted from the tower in 1934. Experimental broadcasts continued from the tower for the following decade.</p>

<p>This quite conspicuous building is a data centre— one of Brisbane's busiest, since it is a 'Point of Presence' for 4 Internet eXchange Points (IXPs). IXPs are places where internet service and content providers can exchange traffic with each other directly instead of paying someone in the middle to do so for them. IXPs are basically the 'inter' part of the internet.</p>
<p>IXPs were originally based in a single physical location, but now they often span many data centres to be able to connect more and more networks together. This building hosts 4 IXPs and about 175 individual networks connect through here to one IXP or another. A lot of medium to large sized Australian internet access providers are here, as are some big content sources like Microsoft and Cloudflare.</p>
<p>
There are about 15 other buildings in and around Brisbane just like this one, where you (or more likely your large organisation) can connect to an IXP, most of which are in the City and Valley area, with a few in Eight Mile Plains. If you want to find out more about IXPs in your area and who is connected to them, the website <a href="https://www.peeringdb.com/">PeeringDB</a> is a good place to start.</p>

    <p>As a kid growing up in neighbouring Bracken Ridge, I was awestruck at the size of this huge antenna sitting in the middle of a huge empty paddock. I'd heard that it was where ABC radio was broadcast from, but I never knew how that came to be the case until recently.</p>
	
    <p>Up until World War II, all radio transmissions originated from the building now known as Macarthur Chambers, at the corner of Queen and Edward Streets. However, once WWII got going and General Macarthur set up shop in that building, it was thought that all those antennas made the building a pretty easy target. So in 1942 the transmitters for 4QG and 4QR were moved out here to a 43 hectare field in Bald Hills.</p>
    <p>The transmitter was, and still is, powerful enough to broadcast far beyond Australian borders. In 1975, after 55 years of 'administration' of the Territory of New Guinea, the Australian Government commenced broadcasts to the newly independent nation of Papua New Guinea. </p>
    <p>What was not intended, however, was that the transmitter's signal was so strong it drew complaints from India that it was causing interference with a station in Madras, and so for some time its power had to be reduced each night.</p>

<p>I know it's not the most exciting looking building, but it is important—at least to me—because all internet traffic to and from my house passes through this building; all my emails and messages, TV and movie streams, video calls, social feeds, shopping—everything. On the way out, this stuff usually passes through Sydney, and if the destination is overseas, it usually ends up being sent onward via the US west coast.</p>
<p>I guess it looks pretty nondescript, but knowing what we now know, the constant stream of white utes outside is a bit of a clue; equipment technicians of all stripes book appointments to go in and tend to their routers, switches, air conditioners, electricity generators, fire suppression systems—all the stuff that makes a data centre run.</p>

<p>How did I figure this out? In short, I ran a lot of <a href="https://support.n4l.co.nz/s/article/How-to-use-Tracert-Traceroute">traceroute</a> commands and deciphered the results with the help of some research into the telecommunications industry. Here's an example of a trace I made from my home internet connection to <a href="https://www.archive.org">archive.org</a> in San Francisco.

<p>344 Queen Street is line number 3 of this trace — the 'bri' represents Brisbane and my (moderately informed) guesses are that 'que' is Queen Street and 'pow' is <a target="blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerTel">Powertel</a>, a company that built fibre networks in Australian capital cities in the late 90s. Powertel was partially owned by a group of electricity companies, using their networks of underground ducts to thread their optical fibre through. The Company was later acquired by AAPT, which is now a part of TPG (which has a list of aquisitions and subsidiaries too long to list here, only to mention that they are <a target="blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPG_(ISP)">Australia's second largest ISP by customer volume after Telstra</a>.</p>

<p>Lines 4 to 6 are well-known data centre locations in Sydney - Ross St, Glebe (AAPT - another TPG acquisition) and Harris St, Ultimo (Global Switch).</p>

<p>This particular trace goes through Hong Kong (7) and Tokyo (8) before making its way to San Jose , California (9) and up to San Francisco (10).</p>

    <p>Here's a little bit of South-East Queensland history for you. An international submarine telegraph cable landed right here Southport in 1902⁠—part of a larger network of cables that connected colonies of the British Empire. This particular cable crossed the Pacific, passing through Norfolk Island (where it branched off to New Zealand), Fiji and Fanning Island on its way to Vancouver Island in Canada.</p>
    <p>There were already international submarine cables to Australia (via Perth, Darwin and Bundaberg), but as this one was owned wholly by the Crown, it meant the Empire would have complete control of communications between its colonies in the event of war via its cable network known as the All Red Line. The addition of the new cable also reportedly lowered the cost to Australians of sending a telegram.</p>

    <p>P.S. I just looked up whether you can even send telegrams anymore, and you can! It’ll cost you about $30 though, so I figured the humble e-postcard would be just as effective.</p>
