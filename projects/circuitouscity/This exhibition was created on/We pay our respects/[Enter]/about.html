<i>Circuitous City</i> challenges the worth of the internet's ideals of speed and efficiency. The work asks us to consider our ability (as users) to shape our technological and interpersonal networks with our own values, rather than those thrust upon us by capitalism under the guise of convenience. <i>Circuitous City</i> acknowledges that the fastest and most direct route may not necessarily be the one that serves us and our interests best. The works ask, "how else can we share data?" and "what else can a network do?" with consideration of who benefits most from mainstream society’s current approaches to communications technology.

Opt-in to receive copies of the set of postcards developed for the exhibition, and learn about the intertwined relationships of communications infrastructure and power through landmarks around South-East Queensland. The postcards, as well as copies of the Sneakernet! Zine and Residential Gateway video, will be delivered by the artist throughout the course of the exhibition.
      </p>
      <p>
	  Digital versions of the postcards will be published to the <a href="correspondence.html">Correspondence</a> page of this site and the <a target="blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tinyletter.com/circuitouscity">Circuitous City mailing list</a> alongside blog posts reflecting on the embodied network created in the process of making deliveries.

      <h4>ABOUT THE ARTIST</h4>
      <p>
        Adam McFillin is an artist engaged in producing sound, installation and
        performance works that investigate power and its presence in the
        signals, protocols and infrastructure of communications networks.
        Through deconstruction and misuse, they aim to reveal the materiality of
        digital networks and the abstractions that exist between users and
        technology.<br /><br />
