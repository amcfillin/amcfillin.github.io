<h4>13 Nov: Maroochydore Cable Landing Station</h4>

<div id="cardtext">
    <p>Remember when I was in Southport, talking about that old submarine telegraph cable? It turns out South-East Queensland has entered the submarine cable game again, this time on the Sunshine Coast. The new cable connects Maroochydore to Sydney and Guam of all places—though that's not as strange as it may sound. Guam is actually a major international hub of undersea cable connectivity, owing to its location in the middle of the West Pacific...oh, and the fact that it's a US territory.</p>
    <p>Not only is Guam a strategic location for connectivity to Asia and the Pacific for the US and companies doing business there, the US military also sees it as an important location, with 29% of the island occupied by military bases. Looking at Guam on a map, its proximity to a few countries the US has (or has had) some friction with may begin to explain why that is the case. </p>
	
    <p>Similarly to 1902, when a powerful Great Britain built and owned cables all over the world, this cable will be one of a growing number partially owned by Google.</p>
	
    <p>An unusual thing about this cable station—apart from the fact it's quite a way inland from the sea—is that it stands out amongst its surroundings. Traditionally, cable stations are hidden inside unassuming or purposefully misleading looking buildings to avoid unwanted attention or sabotage. Whether this kind of 'security by obscurity' has been found not to work or has simply been trumped by the local council's desire to showcase its location as a literal on-ramp to the information superhighway, I'm not sure.  
    </p>
    <p>Whatever the case, if you swim at Maroochydore beach in the future, take a moment to think about the 36 terabits per second of internet traffic flowing metres beneath your feet!</p>

    <p>Today I discovered that the first experiments with telephones in so-called Brisbane took place here at the General Post Office in 1878⁠—about 2 years after Alexander Graham Bell's initial demonstrations.</p>
	
	<p>The telephone was also demonstrated that year at a particularly ground-breaking Brisbane Exhibition, along with the electric light (!) and electric detonation of torpedoes in the creek running through Bowen Park (a precursor to the modern Ekka fireworks show?).</p>
    
    <p>But back to the GPO. In addition to being the central Post Office, a telegraph wing was added  in 1879 and a floor was dedicated for use as the first telephone exchange in the region in 1880. </p>
	
    <p>During World War II, the building's front was also used as a saluting dais for military parades. And while its telegraphic, telephonic and militaristic days are over, the building continues to serve as an operational post office.</p>

<h4>10 Nov: Delivery Report</h4>

<p >Last delivery report I mentioned that this process has been a reminer of the spread out, sprawling nature of the Brisbane area, but it turns out I&rsquo;d spoken too soon. This past weekend saw me making deliveries to the northernmmost and southernmost points so far (the Redcliffe and Logan areas respectively).</p>

<p >I had planned to use this delivery report to talk about how, while the focus of the postcards is on infrastructure in a formal sense, the sneakernet we are creating is also a less formal kind of infrastructure&mdash;one that relies less on large scale technology, but more on the people that make it up. In the case of the Circuitous City sneakernet, though, this informal infrastructure has relied a lot more heavily than I expected upon the very formal and concrete infrastructure of our roadways, not to mention the Global Positioning System (GPS).</p>

<p >I guess it&rsquo;s a timely reminder that putting our heads in the sand when it comes to technology is not an option (because hey, let&rsquo;s start by defining technology&mdash;where do you draw that line?). What is an option, though, is making choices and navigating the tradeoffs inherent in them. For example, these deliveries trade speed and longevity (since they only occur for two weeks) for a slightly more personal touch and an element of novelty.</p>

<p >I guess it all comes down to control. The people that built the infrastructure featured on these postcards had it, and by building other infrastructures&mdash;however short-lived, fragile, concrete or ethereal they are&mdash;they can give us control too.</p>

<p>This quite conspicuous building is a data centre— one of Brisbane's busiest, since it is a 'Point of Presence' for 4 Internet eXchange Points (IXPs). IXPs are places where internet service and content providers can exchange traffic with each other directly instead of paying someone in the middle to do so for them. IXPs are basically the 'inter' part of the internet.</p>
<p>IXPs were originally based in a single physical location, but now they often span many data centres to be able to connect more and more networks together. This building hosts 4 IXPs and about 175 individual networks connect through here to one IXP or another. A lot of medium to large sized Australian internet access providers are here, as are some big content sources like Microsoft and Cloudflare.</p>
<p>
There are about 15 other buildings in and around Brisbane just like this one, where you (or more likely your large organisation) can connect to an IXP, most of which are in the City and Valley area, with a few in Eight Mile Plains. If you want to find out more about IXPs in your area and who is connected to them, the website <a target="blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.peeringdb.com/">PeeringDB</a> is a good place to start.</p>

<div id="cardtext">
    <p>The Old Windmill (I guess just "The Windmill" back then) on Wickham Terrace is the oldest surviving convict-built structure in the city. It was used for a number of purposes, not the least of which were reputed public executions and the torturous practice of milling grain by treadmill as punishment (without trial) for gangs of prisoners. Some say there was never enough wind to mill grain on its own, others say the windmill did work but was continually in need of repair. But I digress...</p>
    <p>The windmill tower was used as a signal station to communicate (by semaphore—yep, waving red and yellow flags)  shipping information between the port and town. Railways, shipping, and other industry, also relied on the station for its function as a time keeping station. That ball you see at the top of the tower would drop at 1pm every day.</p>
    <p>The windmill later became a site for experimentation with radio, leading to Queensland's first  television broadcast being transmitted from the tower in 1934. Experimental broadcasts continued from the tower for the following decade.</p>

<h4>6 Nov: Delivery Report</h4>

<p >On Tuesday night, I ventured out to drop off packages in South Brisbane, Bardon and Auchenflower. Thanks to those recipients for signing up, and thanks also to those who have signed up since then. If you have not received a package yet, keep your eyes peeled for a delivery in the coming week. If you&rsquo;ve already received a delivery, perhaps consider sharing a zine or postcard with someone else to extend this burgeoning sneakernet?</p>

<p >I&rsquo;ve been enjoying the process of seeing delivery requests come in and marking them out on the <a target="blank" rel="noopener" href="https://circuitous.city/This%20exhibition%20was%20created%20on%20and%20about%20the%20traditional%20lands%20of%20the%20Dyungungoo%20(Gubbi%20Gubbi),%20Turrbal,%20Jagera,%20Yugambeh,%20and%20Bundjalung%20peoples,%20whose%20sovereignty%20was%20never%20ceded/We%20pay%20our%20respects%20to%20their%20elders%20past%20and%20present%20and%20extend%20that%20respect%20to%20all%20Indigenous%20peoples%20today/%5BEnter%5D/index.html">map</a>&mdash;not to mention making my way through the city to places I don&rsquo;t often have an excuse to go to (and some that I do). This process has reminded me just how sprawling and spread out a city we live in.</p>

<p >Beyond the re/discovery aspect, the most validating part for me is being able to reach people who are also interested in questioning the ways we communicate and are open to less conventional or more creative approaches to exchanging information. By this I don&rsquo;t mean to make any arguments along the lines of &ldquo;offline vs online&rdquo;, or for the perceived &ldquo;authenticity&rdquo; of some medium over another, but to offer an invitation to reconsider the ways in which we interact and communicate.</p>

<p >In my last delivery report I talked about how it&rsquo;s usually quite unlikely that we will purposefully inconvenience ourselves, unless perhaps it is for a principle or value that means a lot to us. My hope is that this show provides a space to ask questions like; What would such a principle or value be for you? What do you make an extra effort for? Could you try to cultivate that value or principle through your networks or the way you communicate?</p>

<p >During the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, <a target="blank" rel="noopener" href="https://theconversation.com/the-community-led-movement-creating-hope-in-the-time-of-coronavirus-134391">mutual aid networks</a> have been a great example of this. The networks of community support that invariably come together in response to natural disasters also spring to mind. Of course, there is also the long running Cuban sneakernet, <a target="blank" rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/hccxb/el-paquete-semanal-the-weeks-internet-in-havana-8091849f11f6">El Paquete Semanal</a>, which has entirely different motivations!</p>

<p>I know it's not the most exciting looking building, but it is important—at least to me—because all internet traffic to and from my house passes through this building; all my emails and messages, TV and movie streams, video calls, social feeds, shopping—everything. On the way out, this stuff usually passes through Sydney, and if the destination is overseas, it usually ends up being sent onward via the US west coast.</p>
<p>I guess it looks pretty nondescript, but knowing what we now know, the constant stream of white utes outside is a bit of a clue; equipment technicians of all stripes book appointments to go in and tend to their routers, switches, air conditioners, electricity generators, fire suppression systems—all the stuff that makes a data centre run.</p>

<p>How did I figure this out? In short, I ran a lot of <a target="blank" rel="noopener" href="https://support.n4l.co.nz/s/article/How-to-use-Tracert-Traceroute">traceroute</a> commands and deciphered the results with the help of some research into the telecommunications industry.

<p>344 Queen Street is line number 3 of this trace — the 'bri' represents Brisbane and my (moderately informed) guesses are that 'que' is Queen Street and 'pow' is <a target="blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerTel">Powertel</a>, a company that built fibre networks in Australian capital cities in the late 90s. Powertel was partially owned by a group of electricity companies, and they used these companies' networks of underground ducts (as opposed to paying a fee to other duct owners such as Telstra) to thread their optical fibre through. The Company was later acquired by AAPT, which is now a part of TPG (which has a list of aquisitions and subsidiaries too long to list here, only to mention that they are <a target="blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPG_(ISP)">Australia's second largest ISP by customer volume after Telstra</a>).</p>

<p>Lines 4 to 6 are well-known data centre locations in Sydney - Ross St, Glebe (AAPT - another TPG acquisition) and Harris St, Ultimo (Global Switch).</p>

<p>This particular trace goes through Hong Kong (7) and Tokyo (8) before making its way to San Jose , California (9) and up to San Francisco (10).</p>

    <p>As a kid growing up in neighbouring Bracken Ridge, I was awestruck at the size of this huge antenna sitting in the middle of a huge empty paddock. I'd heard that it was where ABC radio was broadcast from, but I never knew how that came to be the case until recently.</p>
	
    <p>Up until World War II, all radio transmissions originated from the building now known as Macarthur Chambers, at the corner of Queen and Edward Streets. However, once WWII got going and General Macarthur set up shop in that building, it was thought that all those antennas made the building a pretty easy target. So in 1942 the transmitters for 4QG and 4QR were moved out here to a 43 hectare field in Bald Hills.</p>
    <p>The transmitter was, and still is, powerful enough to broadcast far beyond Australian borders. In 1975, after 55 years of 'administration' of the Territory of New Guinea, the Australian Government commenced broadcasts to the newly independent nation of Papua New Guinea. </p>
    <p>What was not intended, however, was that the transmitter's signal was so strong it drew complaints from India that it was causing interference with a station in Madras, and so for some time its power had to be reduced each night.</p>

    <p>
	Before I started making these deliveries, I had been imagining the kinds of things I would contemplate, the places I might stop at, the ways I might get around. Of course, in these daydreams I completely neglected the reality of being a person in a productivity-obsessed society with things like deadlines and responsibilities and other people in my life to consider!
	</p>
	
	<p>
	In the <a target="blank" rel="noopener" href="zine.html">Sneakernet! zine</a> I talked a lot about how on the internet, the most "efficient" route is the one that serves the owners and providers of infrastructure. With that said, almost none of us have time to be purposefully taking the slow route or inconveniencing ourselves for a principle (unless that principle means quite a lot to us) when there is stuff.to.get.done. As a practical example, even if you have an art show dedicated to considering these kinds of things, you still have to do stuff like buy and sell furniture for your upcoming house move, and take a large detour, travelling from Stafford to Highgate Hill via Kallangur (about an 80km round trip) to, say, pick up some nice dining chairs in good condition at a nice price.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	So realisation number one today was that having the time and mental space to resist these capital-driven pressures on our time is absolutely a luxury. I think this conflict is pretty key to the whole point of the show, really, and I hope to unpack it a little more over time as these field reports progress.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The second thing I noticed while I was out clocking up kilometres in the car, was my resistance to inconveniencing myself. I had things to do, deliveries to make, and usually, I am pretty single-minded about getting to where I'm going. In the spirit of my prior daydreams about the show, I convinced myself to pull over at a park in Shand Street, Stafford to make some notes and this short audio recording. It was a nice surprise that this spot seemed to be a popular spot for bird life.
	</p>
    
<p>
The "efficiency" (or lack thereof) of today's trip aside, I felt grateful for the opportunity to begin sharing the postcards, zine and video that I've been working on over the past couple of months with people who I hope will appreciate them, and in doing so, forming the first connections in the sneakernet I'm enacting for this show.

    <p>Here's a little bit of South-East Queensland history for you. An international submarine telegraph cable landed right here Southport in 1902⁠—part of a larger network of cables that connected colonies of the British Empire. This particular cable crossed the Pacific, passing through Norfolk Island (where it branched off to New Zealand), Fiji and Fanning Island on its way to Vancouver Island in Canada.</p>
    <p>There were already international submarine cables to Australia (via Perth, Darwin and Bundaberg), but as this one was owned wholly by the Crown, it meant the Empire would have complete control of communications between its colonies in the event of war via its cable network known as the All Red Line. The addition of the new cable also reportedly lowered the cost to Australians of sending a telegram.</p>

	Thanks for taking the time to visit the exhibition. This page will grow throughout the course of the next two weeks with postcards from communications landmarks around South-East Queensland and other updates from my travels while delivering the works from this exhibition. I hope you find these infrastructural tidbits as interesting as I did. If you'd like to have the updates delivered to your inbox, these posts will also be sent out via the <a target="blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tinyletter.com/circuitouscity">Circuitous City mailing list</a>.</p>
