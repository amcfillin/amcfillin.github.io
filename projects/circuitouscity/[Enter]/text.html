	  <p><i>- words by Joel Stern.</i></p>

<p>On first hearing the words &lsquo;Circuitous City&#39;, the title of Brisbane-based artist Adam McFillin&rsquo;s new project at Outer Space ARI, I intuitively read it as a reference, or circumvention perhaps, of the idea of the &lsquo;smart city&rsquo;. Perhaps this was a residual association of years exposed to &lsquo;smart state&rsquo; branding, primarily on number plates hooning past me down Brisbane streets in the mid to late noughties, when I lived in the city. The &lsquo;smart state&rsquo; always presented, at least for people in my circle, an irresistible invitation for d&eacute;tournement; simply replace the word &lsquo;smart&rsquo; with &lsquo;police&rsquo;, and voil&agrave;, the city was magically returned to its recognisable form.</p> 

<p>This cynicism, on reflection, was not really to do with any notion of &lsquo;smartness&rsquo; as an ideal, but more about Brisbane and Queensland&rsquo;s perennial capacity for self-promotion without ever really outgrowing the provincial and repressive atmosphere that made, for instance, most artists want to leave as soon as possible. The &lsquo;smart state&rsquo; experiment, in any case, was <a target="blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/queensland-no-longer-the-smart-state-20120722-22hpw.html">relatively short lived</a>. A Peter Beattie pet project, it was within a few years replaced with Cambell Newman&rsquo;s &lsquo;Sunshine State&rsquo;, a pretty transparent rebuke that seemed to express everything about the Newman era; &lsquo;fuck education, research and innovation, enjoy the sunshine, don&rsquo;t think too much about corruption, environmental vandalism and blatant power grabbing&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Around that same time however, just as &lsquo;smart&rsquo; was discarded by brand-Queensland, the word was being quite profoundly remade in other ways, and other contexts. &lsquo;Smart city&rsquo; discourses emerged largely from the ashes of the 2008 global economic crisis, led by companies like IBM (whose &lsquo;smarter cities&rsquo; and &lsquo;smarter planet&rsquo; initiatives instantiated the notion) working in concert with governments to proselytise all manner of wondrous techno-solutions to the many political, economic and social problems related to the GFC. The idea was seductive and profitable, and within a short period &lsquo;smart&rsquo; had become a byword for everything new, shiny and technological; networked, automated, data-driven, algorithmic forms of infrastructure and governance. Speed, efficiency, convenience, mobility for all. And, of course, for those with a more critical purview, total surveillance of all social, political and economic life, in a panoptic panacoustic new world of capture and control.</p> 

<p>The techno-politics of the smart city &nbsp;are as dystopian or utopian as one&rsquo;s imagination allows, and the world we&rsquo;ve found ourselves in now is one of profoundly competing narratives. For every frictionless experience of convenience and mobility in a sensor society, there is an attendant horror; algorithmic racial profiling reinforced by predictive policing, platform and surveillance capitalism fuelled by social media addiction, data extractivism and colonialism, psychological warfare in the form of targeted messaging, fake news and propaganda&mdash;all delivered at lightning speed. As Paul Virilio told us decades ago in &lsquo;Speed and Politics&rsquo;, acceleration and militarization are natural bedfellows. Here we are then, having arrived in the conglomeration of the two slogans, the &lsquo;smart police state&rsquo;. </p>

<p>So, what then is a circuitous city? I think the answer is grounded in questions of visibility and audibility, and therefore comprehensibility. &lsquo;Smart&rsquo; infrastructures and interfaces are architecturally embedded in ways that render them and the operations they perform opaque, silent, invisible, illegible. We cannot properly grasp fibre-optics beneath our feet, WiFi in the air, unmarked and anonymous data centres and cable huts in suburbs we don&rsquo;t visit. For Adam McFillin, I suspect, a &lsquo;circuitous city&rsquo; then is one that could be brought into being through acts of creativity and resistance that render the city and the materiality of its infrastructures and networks legible.</p> 

<p>In this sense, a circuitous city is perhaps more methodological than ontological; and the question is, what experimental strategies might be mobilised in order to make a city more circuitous, less &lsquo;smart&rsquo;, and therefore somehow, once again, comprehensible to us. Thinking this way, the Situationist spirit and psychogeographic heart of McFillin&rsquo;s project becomes clearer. Just like the detourning of a license plate on a vehicle which then circulates throughout the city, McFillin&rsquo;s work is grounded in tactical defiance, mapping, navigating, traversing and connecting spaces differently so that they might articulate another kind of network; one that is noisy, slow, ultimately more properly social and less atomising in the kinds of relationships it produces between users, and the spaces they inhabit.</p> 

<p>McFillin&rsquo;s methods for this task are resolutely analogue (even where they are invariably communicated online)&mdash;paper zines, postcards, field reports and wanderings, in person door dropoffs&mdash;and I think this is important because so many of us still sense in the analogue something resembling, equating to, &lsquo;the real&rsquo;, or as <a target="blank" rel="noopener" href="http://cultureandcommunication.org/galloway/what-is-the-analog">Alexander Galloway eloquently put it</a></span><span class="c3">, representation &lsquo;fully coextensive with reality&rsquo;. To be coextensive is to share time and space in ways made sensible to us, which I think is what McFillin is hoping for in this work, and something that remains always necessary. To reveal ourselves to one another, within the network, and to reimagine the city as we circulate through it. </p>
