<h3>MUSIC FOR AT MUSICIANS (2015)</h3>

<p>Music for AT Musicians is an installation consisting of dial-up 
modems, software and projections. As producers of audible signal, the 
ensemble of modems performs from a score based on the text of their own 
instruction manual. The modems are conducted by custom software (using 
the Hayes AT command set) to play tones relating to and in sync with the
 on-screen text projection. </p>

<p>Unlike more recent network technologies, the modem exposes data's 
ultimate translation into signal, the transmitted form that is usually 
hidden from the user. The modem's audibility completes a feedback loop 
with the user, referencing the historical practice of 'debugging by 
ear'.</p>

<p>While the modem is a perfect generator of signal, its limited tonal 
range, timbre and speed speaks to the difficulty of explanation and loss
 of information inherent in the translations that occur between user 
input and its eventual transformation into signal.</p>
