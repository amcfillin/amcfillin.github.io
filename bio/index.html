title: Adam McFillin - Bio
---
<div>
<p>Adam McFillin is an artist engaged in producing performance and installation works that investigate protocol, power and structure in communications networks. His work is often sound-based and has focused on exposing the materiality of signal (Music for AT Musicians) and the abstraction of protocol (D:I:V:I:S:O:N, Loopback).</p>

<p>Adam channels his enthusiasm for user-controlled networks into CTRLYROWN; the banner under which he runs a topic-driven twitter account and experiments with locally-focused non-internet Wifi networks. </p>

<p>He has created scores for film, television and theatre, as well as
sound design for location-specific media artworks. He is an actively performing and recording musician.</p>

<p>Adam received an MFA from the University at Buffalo Department of Media Study, a 
Graduate Certificate in Screen Music from Australian Film, Television 
and  Radio School (AFTRS), and a Bachelor of Information Technology from Queensland University of Technology.</p>
