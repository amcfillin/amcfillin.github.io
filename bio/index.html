title: Adam McFillin - Bio
---
<div>
<p>Adam McFillin is an artist engaged in producing sound, installation and performance works that investigate power through the protocols and structures of communications networks. His work is often sound-based and has focused on exposing the materiality of signal (Music for AT Musicians, On the Wire) and the abstraction of protocol (D:I:V:I:S:I:O:N, Loopback).</p>

<!-- <p>Adam channels his enthusiasm for user-controlled networks into CTRLYROWN; the banner under which he runs a topic-driven twitter account and experiments with locally-focused non-internet Wifi networks. </p>
-->

<p>He has created scores for film, television and theatre, as well as
sound design for location-specific media artworks. He is an actively performing and recording musician.</p>
  
  <p>Adam's work has been shown at venues including Hallwalls Contemporary Arts Centre and Squeaky Wheel Film & Media Art Center, and at the Radical Networks and Our Networks conferences. His commissioned sound work has been heard at The Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University, MOCO Panac√©e - Montpellier Contemporain, Australian Centre for the Movng Image (ACMI) and on ABC (Australia) television.</p>

<p>Adam received an MFA from the University at Buffalo Department of Media Study, a 
Graduate Certificate in Screen Music from Australian Film, Television 
and  Radio School (AFTRS), and a Bachelor of Information Technology from Queensland University of Technology.</p>
